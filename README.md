# Portfolio-HTML-CSS
The project is the result of my recent 'advanced' learning of HTML &amp; CSS(Flexbox and CSS Grid)

After spending some time learning 'new things' that came to HTML&CSS, I've been exploring Web Design rules, layouts etc.
(These were new to me because first time I was learning HTML and CSS as a 12 years old kid to make simple changes while building WordPress websites.)

I decided to use 'Grid layout' to show my knowledge about CSS Grid. I've also included Flexbox in few sections.
I've used @keyframes for transitions.

These are other things I would like to mention:
1. The 'carousel' element(Projects section) should work while hovering over each project. I haven't added any JS and thats why it doesn't have any function.
2. I would rather use JS for those transitions, but found a way to use @keyframes to change background only using CSS.
